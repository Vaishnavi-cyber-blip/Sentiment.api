# Sentiment Analysis Model, API, and Android Application

## Overview
This project includes a sentiment analysis model with 84% accuracy, an API for performing sentiment analysis using Flask, and an Android application that uses the API to analyze sentiment.
## Sentiment Analysis Model
The sentiment analysis model is a machine learning model that has been trained to classify text as positive, negative, or neutral. The model has gained an accuracy of 84%.

### About Dataset
The model was trained using a large Twitter dataset (current X) of text reviews and their corresponding sentiment labels ( Positive:1, Negative:-1, and Neutral:0)

The dataset was preprocessed by cleaning the text, removing stop words, numerical valu and performing stemming. The model was then trained using a variety of machine-learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. The model with the highest accuracy was selected for use in the API.
